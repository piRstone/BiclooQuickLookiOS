See Nantes city's bikes availabilities

## Goal of this app

The goal is to use the power of Today Widget, Apple Watch app and later iOS 14 Widgets to see quickly how many bikes and stands are available at your favorite stations.

The interest is to not to have to open the application when you don't have the time to do that.

## Backlog

- [ ] Main application (add favorite stations, define favorite journey)
- [ ] Make Today Widget
- [ ] Make Apple Watch application
- [ ] Make iOS 14 home screen Widget
